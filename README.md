TEXT-EDITOR-FOR-ANDROID
=======================

Simple notepad app to open, edit and save text files to and from the SD card.
This application operates by manipulating plain text files on your phone's SD card. By default, these files are stored in the Documents directory. This is both to make the files more accessible, and to prevent accidental lose of data when un-installing the application. If this folder does not already exist, it will be created. Additionally, the application will store snapshots of edits to files between saves. 
Text Editor does not require a .txt file extension when naming a new file. Windows and Mac OS users may wish to add one if they plan on copying their file to their computer. For stability reasons, files larger than 102400 characters can not be shared.
